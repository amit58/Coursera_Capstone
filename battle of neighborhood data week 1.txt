Data

To help Reshmi Mazumdar for her dream project we need below data:

1. All area names of kolkata which we have reserached and make a csv file.
2. Based on area name we have accessed longitute and latitute data by using geolocator.
3. Based on area name, longitute and latitute data we have accessed nearby venues by foursquare API.
4. For each location we got N numbers of venues with different categories i.e. chinese restaurant, cinema , station etc.
