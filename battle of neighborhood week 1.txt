Capstone project - Battle of neighborhoods

Introduction

I live in a city called Kolkata. It's one of metropolitan city in India. 
French author Dominique Lapierre called this City of Joy, It can be considered as food capital of india.
So recently one of my friend Reshmi Mazumdar wished to open a chienese restaurant in Kolkata.
But she is not sure about the location where she should open her restaurant.
So she discussed with me about her dream project as she was aware about my learning Data science in Coursera.

So I thought below bussiness problem for her:

1. She should open her restaurent in a location where  there are enough customers and minimum competitor restorant.
2. We should explore all the qualified venues in kolkata to decide best location for chinese restaurent.
3. Need to know what category of customers are avaailable whether they are target customers by their age.
4. Based on all the information we need to maximize score and decide the best location.
